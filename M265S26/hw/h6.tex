\textcolor{red}{Your comments on your own proof here. You can (should) include things like:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much help did you need? None? A little? A lot?
\item Ask me questions. `` I never did see where I used the hypothesis.... but it still seems right to me." or "My proof is so different from yours I can't tell if this is ok??"
\item Corrections to your own work: I forgot to be careful about dividing by zero.
\end{itemize}}

\item[\textbf{21.}] If $p$ is prime and $k$ is an integer for which $0 < k < p,$ then $p$ divides ${ p \choose k}.$


\textbf{Quick Review:} For positive integers $n$ and $k$, the symbol $\displaystyle { n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ and it counts the number of $k$-element subsets from a set with $n$-elements. By implication, the output of $\displaystyle { n \choose k}$ must be an integer. You can delete this review from your solutions.

\textbf{Fact you can use:} You can use the notion of a \textbf{prime factorization} of a positive integer -- more specifically -- any positive integer can be written as a product of prime numbers.
