\begin{document}
\noindent \textbf{Topics by Section}\\

\fbox{3.2}  Stable matchings, Gale-Shapley Proposal Algorithm\\

\fbox{4.1} separating set/vertex cut, connectivity, $\kappa(G)$, $k$-connectivity, disconnecting set of edges, $k$-edge-connectivity, edge-connectivity, $\kappa'(G),$ edge cut\\

Whitney's Theorem (4.1.9) If $G$ is a simple graph, $\kappa(G) \leq \kappa'(G) \leq \delta(G).$\\

Them 4.1.11 If $G$ is 3-regular, then $\kappa(G) = \kappa'(G).$\\

\fbox{4.2} internally disjoint $uv$-paths, $xy$-cut\\

Whitney's Theorem (4.2.2) A graph $G$ with at least 3 vertices is 2-connected if and only if for each pair $u,v \in V(G)$ there exist internally disjoint $uv$-paths.\\

Theorem 4.2.4 (a list of 4 statements equivalent to being 2-connected)\\

Menger's Theorem: If $x,y$ are nonadjacent vertices of the graph $G,$ then the minimum number of edges in an $xy$-cut is equal to the maximum number of pairwise internally disjoint $xy$-paths.
