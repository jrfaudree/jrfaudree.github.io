\hrulefill

\begin{itemize}
\item Any student who scores below 85\% is {\it{required}} to re-take the quiz. Students with higher scores may re-take the quiz if they chose.
\item If a student retakes the quiz, the two scores will be averaged, even if the second score is lower than the first.
\item While the second quiz will contain problems from the same sections of the book as the first quiz, {\bf{it will not be exactly the same as the first quiz}}.
\item Any re-take must be completed within a week of taking the first quiz.
\item In order to retake the quiz, you must 
\begin{itemize}
\item get your graded quiz back and re-work any missed problems {\bf{on a separate piece of paper}}
\item work a similar problem from the text for each problem missed on the quiz  {\bf{on a separate piece of paper}}
\item schedule a time outside of class (with Jill or Hector) to retake the quiz and bring your graded quiz, the paper with the corrected problems, and the additional problems to this meeting.
\end{itemize}
