\large{\textbf{Homework Guidelines}} \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Always write the problem (or the thing you are proving) at the top. That is, do not prove a statement without writing that statement down.
\item Always write \textbf{Proof} when you begin your proof.
\item Always use complete sentences -- in English not symbolic logic -- with correct grammar and punctuation.
\item Never begin a sentence with a symbol.\\

For example if you want to say that the set $A$ is a subset of the set $B$, you want to write:\\ ``The set $A$ is a subset of the set $B.$" You do not want to write \\``$A$ is a subset of $B.$"

\item Do not use the symbols: $\Rightarrow$, $\forall$ or $\exists.$
\item State the proof method you are using if that method is anything other than a direct proof.
\item Never ever turn in your first draft. 
\item When re-reading your proofs, check for correctness but also grammatical errors and inefficiencies. (Do you really need all three cases? Did you really need proof by contradiction?)
\end{enumerate}
